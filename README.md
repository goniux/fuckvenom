Hi, I'm goniux
This is my personal research repository documenting my journey into:
- Windows offensive security
- Shellcoding & low-level exploitation
- Malware development experiments
- Red team tradecraft
- Reverse engineering & analysis

This repo evolves in real time as I learn, experiment, break things, and document everything.

## 🧠 Purpose
This is NOT just code dumping.
Every folder here includes:
✔ Deep technical breakdowns  
✔ Experiment notes  
✔ Failures + lessons learned  
✔ Detection & defensive insights  
✔ Practical red-team perspective  

Goal → Understand how attacks work at a fundamental level.
